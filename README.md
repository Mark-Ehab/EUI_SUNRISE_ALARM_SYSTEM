# Sunrise Alarm Clock Project

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the Sunrise Alarm Clock project developed by MetaWare LLC.

## Introduction

The Sunrise Alarm Clock is a microcontroller-based project that simulates a natural sunrise to wake you up gradually and gently. The project utilizes various components, including an LCD display, a keypad for user interaction, an alarm functionality, a buzzer for alarm sounds, and an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) to detect ambient light levels. The project was developed by the team at MetaWare LLC, consisting of:

## Features

- **Gradual Sunrise Simulation:** The alarm clock uses a gradual increase in light intensity (LED) to mimic a natural sunrise, allowing for a more peaceful and gentle wake-up experience.
- **Customizable Alarms:** Users can set alarms with personalized wake-up times and alarm sounds (buzzer) to suit their preferences.
- **Alarm Cancellation:** Unwanted alarms can be easily canceled using the intuitive keypad interface.
- **Ambient Light Detection:** The LDR detects ambient light levels, allowing the system to adjust the sunrise simulation and alarm behavior based on the environment.
- **Buzzer Activation:** The buzzer is activated when an alarm times out, providing an audible alert to the user.

## Usage

1. Power on the Sunrise Alarm Clock.
2. The main menu will be displayed on the LCD screen.
3. Use the keypad to navigate through the options:
   - Press "0" to set a new alarm.
   - Press "-" to cancel an existing alarm.
   - Press "*" to view the list of set alarms.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to set alarms, customize wake-up settings, or view the list of alarms.
